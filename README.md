OVERVIEW

This appplication was built using NEXT.JS and is styled with Tailwind CSS. The application is hosted statically using Vercel. This is a mobile responsive recreation of Amazon.I make use of fakeshop API and server side rendering, react responsive carousel, heroicons@v1 to build my frontend.Than i implemented the functionality (with the help of Redux) of adding items to the basket,as well as removing them.In the checkout page, you can see how many items do you have in the basket, and the total price of them.I then added the Next Auth with firebase google authentication so you can not press the go to checkout button unless you are logged in.I then implemented Stripe for the checkout process, firestore db to store my orders and render out the orders page with the help of my webhook and stripe.
